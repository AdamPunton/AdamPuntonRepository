    "Trend Following Impact on Modern Portfolio’s\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend following trading is a trading strategy that tends to be overlooked or thought of as impossible. One of the basic trends following strategies is \"time series momentum — going long markets with recent positive returns and shorting those with recent negative returns\" (Hurst, Ooi, and Pedersen 2014). Trend following utilizes technical analysis to determine when to enter and exit a market. Some of the most common technical indicators that are used are moving averages, volatility, and bands. Trend following can be a good diversification to a portfolio or a complete trading strategy with high risk tolerance. Long-term trend following has been the primary usage of trend following traders. The short-term trend following has grown but has not been extensively researched and tried. Long-term trend trading can return above market returns over a significant amount of time. The stigma around technical trading can be helpful and deserved for the average trader. But with a consistent trend following strategy the returns have proven to be capable of above market return. \n",
    "Fundamental analysis is very prevalent in the market today with investors like Warren Buffet touting his version of fundamental analysis. Trend following is the opposite of what investors like Buffet push. Both fundamental and trend following strategies rely on the market not being efficient. Fundamental strategies rely on stocks being underpriced compared to their financial statements and projected earnings, trend following relies on humans following trends with their money. These strategies rely on an inefficient market and prove different ways that the markets are inefficient. The utilization of both strategies could create an extremely diversified portfolio with above market returns.  Figure A shows how BRK-B stock has grown well above the market over the past 20 years. The investors at Berkshire have proven that they are able to consistently beat the market, thus leading to exponentially larger returns in the long run and proving that the market is not efficient. \n",

    "Determining that the market is inefficient is important because fundamental and trend-following strategies would be unable to achieve above-market returns in an efficient market. If the market was efficient \"price changes would be totally unpredictable in the sense that no systematic excess return based on public information can be achievable\" (Lempérière, Deremble, Seager, Potters, and Bouchaud 2014). Spending the many man hours of research and analysis of fundamental investing should lead to average returns and theoretically prove that the market is efficient. This is not the case and doing the research can lead to undervalued stocks being identified. Proving that the market is inefficient using fundamental analysis opens the door for trend following to be a viable strategy. Trend following is a simple trading strategy that seems too good to be true but has proven to be a reliable strategy. Different traders and firms will each have their unique indicators and measurements for trend following. This makes judging trend following strategies difficult, but many different strategies have proven to work. It only takes one to prove that the market is inefficient, which opens the possibility of creating trading strategies like trend following.\n",
    "This project will look at the potential of using a trend following strategy on a portion of your portfolio to diversify and increase potential earnings. Trend following strategies are different for each firm and investor that tries to implement a trend following strategy. Each investor will have their own favorite indicators and moving average tendencies. A study was done on a dynamic trend strategy studied by Garg, Goulding, Harvey, and Mazzoleni has intuitive appeal (Swedroe 2020). When looking at returns for trend following is unique to each strategies specific rules. \n",
    "Trend following has been a trading strategy for a long time and there are many different firms that utilize different versions of their own trading strategies. Chesapeake Capital Corporation has had an average return rate of 11.18% after fees since 1988. The market has returned an average of 10.64% over that same period. Chesapeake Capital Corporation uses a trend following strategy that limits their downside for less volatility. Trend strategies are also critical because their correlation with market returns is non-existent. While the market was tanking in 2022, the management firm AQR's was having one of their best years, \"Its Alternative Trend Strategy also had its best year ever, with a 48.9% net of fees\" (Mackenzie 2023). The most important point of these firms is that they exist and that they have been around for a long time. Trend following is not just a trading strategy of the past but can be utilized in today's portfolios. \n",

    "The tickers that were used to create the base portfolio were AAPL, MS, MSFT, BRK-B, GPK, and TSLA. These tickers create a balanced portfolio between growth and value. This portfolio also has a beta around 1, which is ideal given the returns that this portfolio has returned over the past 7 years. Investors usually invest in companies like banks and oil companies. Utilizing a trend following strategy could be a potential replacement for these investments. The goal would be to capture a larger return while keeping the negative correlation aspect of those companies. Berkshire Hathaway B posted a beta of 0.88 and Graphic Packing Holding Company had a beta of 0.826. Trend following tends to \"tend to exhibit negative downside correlation to equity markets\" (Graham Capital 2021). This gives the portfolio a favorable chance of having smaller drawdowns than the market.\n",
    "The trend following strategy that I based my model off is like Richard Dennis's strategy he taught to the infamous turtle traders. This strategy involves using the 50 day high and the 20 day lows to enter and exit markets (Quantified Strategies 2023). There are many other trend following strategies, a stock trend strategy created by Cole Wilcox and Eric Crittenden produced winning trades 49.3% of the time (Wilcox and Crittenden 2005). This is an exceptional winning percentage for a trend trading strategy, Dennis’s strategy was winning about 5-10% of his trades. This is just one aspect of trend trading, and it shows how different individual strategies are. \n",
    "The model that I used based on Dennis’s strategy has the traders entering a market when a 50 day high happened and would exit with the potential to completely flip their position at the next 20 day low. This is a very simple trading strategy but proved profitable for the turtle traders if they followed the rules. The model runs through any market that the trader wants to trade in and runs the ticker through the trend following strategy. The model tells you to use the close price to determine if the trader should buy, sell, or hold. \n",

    "To scale your position in this strategy you would double your position if another 50 days high happened in the market that you were trading. You also would double your short position if another 20 days low happened so the positions would grow as the trend continued. They managed their risk by having a stop loss order at the price two times the normal daily volatility. Soybeans’ normal daily volatility is around 21 cents, so if you entered long into a soybean future then you would put a stop loss order in at 42 cents below your entry price. This goes the same for when you short a position, the stop loss order would go 42 cents above the entry price.  The model automatically calculates the average range of the past 20 days and tells the trader their daily risk dollar amount. In a $100,000 portfolio the model tells the trader to buy 1 contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "Average range of the past 20 days: 21.425\n",
    "Daily risk: 1071.25\n",
    "Contracts to buy: 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk management part of the strategy is a personal choice but in Richard Dennis's strategy the total risk to the portfolio should be two percent per transaction. To know how many shares or contracts to buy, take the daily volatility times two and multiply that by the value per tick. This gets the total loss value that could happen to your portfolio. Then divide two percent of the portfolio value by the total loss value and that will get you how many contracts to buy while keeping the risk of the portfolio under two percent per transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario where a second buy signal happens and you make double your long position, then the new stop loss order for both trades would be at the stop loss order for the second trade. As the trend continues, the stop loss order can move past your original order. This keeps your risk to a minimal but also allows you to capture some of those profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of trading strategy is simple but has been proven to be effective in the long term. There are a substantial number of large drawdowns, but the wins are even more substantial. Adding this into a portfolio would increase the transactions and tax burden on the portfolio but is a simple trading strategy that does not involve any fundamental research that gives the benefit of diversification and potentially big returns during down times in the overall market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trend following can be used on stocks, the projected return metrics will be smaller because the percentage value of volatility in stocks is much smaller than in futures. Futures can deviate twenty percent of the amount needed to buy the future, where a stock normally will trade in a range of three percent per day. This leads to the overall portfolio being able to hold less positions as trading stocks requires a larger portion of the portfolio value to get to the two percent risk measurement. In a one-hundred-thousand-dollar portfolio, one futures contract in soybeans will put the portfolio under that two percent risk, while that same portfolio would be able to buy one hundred and forty-seven Tesla shares. These Tesla shares will be a much larger portion of the portfolio leading to not being able to hold as many different positions as just investing in futures contracts. Running the Tesla ticker through the model gives the trader a range of $6.79 per day. The model, with a $100,000 portfolio value, tells you to buy 147 contracts. \n",

    "Trend following and a range bound trading strategy can be used in cohesion. Trading a market with a range bound technique rather than switching to a trend following technic after a metric could be a potential strategy. Trend following is making trade when the price is outside of its normal trading range. Range bound trading uses support and resistance levels to trade the market inside that range. The critical part of range bound trading is predicting the range that the market will trade in. Finding these support and resistance prices can come from a Fibonacci strategy. Historically, stock prices tend to obey the Fibonacci retracements as levels of support and resistance (Gunawan 2020). Using Fibonacci retracements to find the bounds to trade is one way of finding trading bounds.\n",

    "There are many different technical trading strategies that would not be possible if the market was efficient. Most of the time these technical strategies will return below average, but they can add insight to a market. This plays into the investors psychology and the technical trader recognizes patterns and aims to profit from them. If the human brain does not change, the opportunities for profitable technical trading will be there. If humans display investors’ behavioral biases, confirmation bias, market frictions, and market interventions trend following will continue to be a trading strategy (Swedroe 2020). With an infinite possibility of trading strategies, the prospect that a technical strategy could never work is false. Technical trading has worked and a simple trend following strategy is an effective way of implementing technical trading into a portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental trading relies on the accurate comparison of projected earnings and value to the current price and trend following relies on the psychology of traders and the reliance on human decision making when it comes to following the herd. Fundamental trading carries the normal market risk of recessions and major world events, while trend following brings a risk of losing two percent of each transaction or whatever you determine your risk tolerance is. Technical analysis scares away a lot of investors because technical traders present it as a miracle trading strategy. This presentation is inaccurate and the simplistic nature of a trend following strategy can turn people off, so they go and invent complicated indicators and strategies to try and get one up on the market. These investors are losing the thing that causes trend following to work. Over complicated technical trading might work in a more efficient market, but the market has substantial inefficiencies. Investors in the market will never have enough information to make an accurate prediction, so simply being in the game and waiting for the big trend seems to work the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the ease of placing trades and developing a trend following strategy that is historically profitable, trend following trading strategies should be considered in portfolios for diversity. Trend following is a very volatile way of investing but even Warren Buffett does not equate volatility with risk. Trend following runs on the fact that \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\" (Jacobs 2022) That voting machine can run far. These are the moments that make trend following profitable and an option for modern portfolios. \n",
