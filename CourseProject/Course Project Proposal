I am proposing a project that would take the NBA's recorded advance stats for teams and individuals and relate that data to betting spreads on over/under, point spread, and individual performance. The NBA has a tremendous amount of data that can be analyzed and compared to each other to try and create a model that can predict outcomes. These outcomes then can be correlated with the different betting spreads and apps, creating a potential to find a system of achieving a consistent average return per game that is positive. Using the advanced stats on individuals and teams, finding correlations with how teams and players perform against other certain players could show unique correlations. Stats like travel distance and days of rest also could be an example of correlation between over/under spreads.
